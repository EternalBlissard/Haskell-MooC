module Boxes where
-- Often, we donâ€™t need a new type, but instead can just reuse a standard type. For example, repesenting car register plate numbers with String
-- But doing so can lead to errors, for example, if we accidentally pass a string representing a car register plate number to a function that expects a string representing a name.
-- To avoid this, we can use newtype to create a new type that is distinct from the original type, but which has the same representation.
-- The newtype keyword is used to define a new type that has exactly one constructor and exactly one field.
-- The new type is distinct from the original type, but has the same representation at runtime.
-- The new type is used to avoid errors by making the type system more precise.
